# nonogramClassicSolver
NonoGram classic solver puzzle solving: The algorithm applies a set of rules iteratively on the puzzle board. Motivated by insights of my experience for solving the puzzle. The solution process is gradual and iterative, where at each step, one can find pixels in the grid that can be “marked” (or darkened) or “blanked” out (using dot marking).  Eventually after marking enough pixels the hidden picture of the puzzle reveals itself to our great satisfaction.
